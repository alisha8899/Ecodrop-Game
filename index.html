<h4>Why Eco-Drop?</h4>
<h3>
The idea of eco-drop came about when students and staff alike struggled to throw away their trash from their previous meal in the correct bin. As the different types of packaging products confused us, it intrigued our group to learn more about what we could do about this everyday struggle. Instead of taking several minutes on Google to determine where our trash should go, 
we reasoned that it would be more beneficial if we learned this information for future reference rather than short term. With this interest in mind, we decided to design our game around this idea.
